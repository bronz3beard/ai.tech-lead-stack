# The Lead Stack: Agent-Ambiguous Workflows

A high-performance repository of "Skills" and RTK-powered tools designed for Tech Leads. These workflows are **Agent-Ambiguous**, allowing any LLM agent (Gemini, Claude, GPT) to assist with implementation planning, code review, and automated testing.

## Requirements

- **RTK (Runtime Toolkit)**: `npm install -g @rtk-ai/rtk`
- **GitHub CLI (gh)**: Required for automated PR management.
- **Browsers (Playwright)**: `npx playwright install chromium`
- **Python Deps**: `pip install python-dotenv playwright`
- **System**: Access to your local Chrome User Data Directory.

* **Firecrawl API**: (Optional) For the `planning-expert` to read external links.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation

Clone this repo and link it globally for easy access:

```bash

# Add this to your ~/.zshrc
alias lead-init='bash /path/to/tech-lead-stack/install.sh --link .'

```

### 2. Initialize a Project

Navigate to any repository you want to automate and run the new alias:

```bash

lead-init

```

### 🛠 Final Checklist

1. **Permissions**: Run `chmod +x scripts/cleanup.sh` in your toolbox repo.
2. **Execution**: You can now run `lead-init` to build it and `lead-clean` to tear it down.
3. **Mission Control**: Your `lead-init` will now automatically run a pre-flight check to make sure you didn't miss a step.

## How to use in any project

### 3. Usage Options

#### Option A: The "Context Injection" (Universal)

If using a web-based agent (Claude.ai, ChatGPT) or starting a fresh session without workspace access:

> "Analyze the skills in /path/to/lead-stack/.ai/skills/. You are now a Tech Lead Agent equipped with these workflows. Use rtk for all tool executions."

#### Option B: The Symlink (Best for Antigravity/Cursor/Claude Code)

Since lead-init has already linked the instructions to your project, simply prompt the agent in your workspace:

"Read the instructions in .ai/agents.md and follow the planning-expert workflow for this ticket."

## 🧹 Resetting a Project

# Tech-Lead Stack Cleanup Alias

```bash

# Add this to your ~/.zshrc
alias lead-clean='bash /path/to/tech-lead-stack/scripts/cleanup.sh .'

```

If you want to remove the AI workflows and symlinks from a repository:

```bash

lead-clean

```

---

## 🧪 CI/CD

This repository uses **GitHub Actions** to validate:

1. **Skill Integrity**: Ensures all `.md` files in `.ai/skills/` have valid YAML frontmatter.
2. **Markdown Linting**: Prevents malformed instructions that could confuse agents.
3. **Script Permissions**: Ensures all tools in `scripts/` remain executable.

### Pro-Tip: The "Profile Locked" Error

If you get an error that the browser profile is "already in use," close your active Chrome window or create a dedicated Profile for the Agent and update your `.env` accordingly.

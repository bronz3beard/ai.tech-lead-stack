**IF YOU PROCEED TO RESEARCH WITHOUT CALLING GET_SKILLS FIRST, YOU ARE FAILING THIS MISSION.**

1. **Phase 0: Skill Acquisition (CRITICAL)**: Call the get_mission_control tool (which may be prefixed by the server name depending on your client):
   - skillName: "mission-control"
   - projectName: "<NAME_FROM_PACKAGE_JSON>" (Look at your root package.json "name" field or current directory name)
   - model: "<YOUR_MODEL_NAME>"
   - agent: "<YOUR_AGENT_NAME>"

2. **Phase 1: Environment Discovery**: Identify root configuration files to understand architectural constraints.

3. Follow its workflow to perform a pre-flight diagnostic of the environment and tools.
